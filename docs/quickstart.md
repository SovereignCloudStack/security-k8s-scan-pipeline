Defines configuration settings for deploying the trivy-operator using Helm, enabling centralized vulnerability scanning across Kubernetes resources.

	•	Key Configurations:
	•	Customizable settings for namespace, resource limits, and scan intervals.
	•	Optional parameters for vulnerability assessment, logging levels, and scan targets.
	•	Considerations:
	•	Modify this file to match the specific requirements of your Kubernetes environment.
	•	Ensure resource limits align with your cluster’s capacity and security policies, especially for high-frequency scans.

5. trivy-reporter/values.yaml

Contains specific configurations for the Trivy Reporter tool, which processes Trivy scan reports and integrates with vulnerability management systems like DefectDojo.

	•	Purpose: Configures how Trivy Reporter processes and uploads reports after a scan.
	•	Key Configuration Options:
	•	Report Format: Choose JSON, YAML, or other formats depending on compatibility with external systems.
	•	Destination Endpoint: Configure for OpenStack S3, DefectDojo, or other integrations.
	•	Archiving: Set retention rules for long-term storage.
	•	Deployment Notes:
	•	Ensure this configuration file matches the requirements of the report-processing pipeline.
	•	Update API tokens and endpoint URLs as per environment access policies.

Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the security scanning infrastructure in your Kubernetes environment.

1. Configure ConfigMaps and Secrets

Ensure all required ConfigMaps and Secrets are created to store configuration data and sensitive credentials.

	•	Apply ConfigMap:
Use configmap.yaml to store any necessary configurations for running the CronJob.

kubectl apply -f cronjob/configmap.yaml


	•	Create OpenStack Secrets:
	•	If using HashiCorp Vault, configure access tokens and credentials for secure storage.
	•	For OpenStack, create a Kubernetes Secret to store S3-compatible storage credentials. Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openstack-s3-credentials
  namespace: security
type: Opaque
data:
  access_key: BASE64_ENCODED_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_key: BASE64_ENCODED_SECRET_KEY



2. Deploy the Trivy CronJob

Deploy the CronJob to schedule periodic Trivy scans and automate report generation.

kubectl apply -f cronjob/trivy-cronjob.yaml

	•	Verify Deployment:
Confirm that the CronJob is scheduled and runs according to the defined interval. Check logs for successful scan completion and OpenStack upload status.

kubectl get cronjob trivy-cronjob -n security
kubectl logs <cronjob-pod-name> -n security


	•	Update Schedule:
Modify the CronJob schedule as necessary in trivy-cronjob.yaml to adjust scan frequency based on security requirements.

3. Deploy the Trivy Operator

The trivy-operator enables cluster-wide vulnerability scanning for container images and Kubernetes resources.

helm install trivy-operator trivy-operator/ -f trivy-operator/values.yaml

	•	Check Operator Status:
Verify the deployment and inspect the generated vulnerability reports:

kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -n security
kubectl describe vulnerabilityreport <report-name> -n security


	•	Operator Configuration:
Adjust settings in values.yaml to control scan frequency, resource constraints, and reporting preferences. Ensure configuration is optimized for the cluster’s scale and compliance requirements.

4. Deploy the Trivy Reporter

The Trivy Reporter manages scan results, enabling seamless integration with DefectDojo or other vulnerability management systems.

helm repo add trivy-dojo-report-operator https://telekom-mms.github.io/trivy-dojo-report-operator/
helm repo update
helm install trivy-reporter trivy-dojo-report-operator/trivy-dojo-report-operator --values trivy-reporter/values.yaml

	•	Integration with DefectDojo:
	•	Set the API endpoint and access token in values.yaml for Trivy Reporter to enable communication with DefectDojo.
	•	Configure automatic import of reports into DefectDojo for continuous vulnerability tracking and management.
	•	Monitor Report Processing:
Confirm that reports are processed and uploaded as intended:

kubectl get pods -l app=trivy-reporter -n security
kubectl logs <reporter-pod-name> -n security



Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, confirm that each component functions as expected:

	1.	CronJob Execution:
	•	Check that the CronJob executes on schedule and generates reports successfully.
	•	Validate that logs show successful completion of scans and uploads to OpenStack.
	2.	Trivy Operator Reports:
	•	Access reports such as VulnerabilityReport, ConfigAuditReport, and RBACAssessmentReport generated in the security namespace.
	•	Example command to retrieve a vulnerability report:

kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -n security


	3.	Trivy Reporter Validation:
	•	Verify that the Trivy Reporter uploads reports to DefectDojo or OpenStack as expected.
	•	Check in DefectDojo for newly imported reports to ensure seamless integration.
	4.	Inspect OpenStack Storage:
	•	Use the OpenStack CLI or dashboard to confirm that reports are uploaded, securely stored, and accessible for review.

Maintenance and Troubleshooting

If issues arise during or after deployment, use these troubleshooting tips:

	•	CronJob Not Running: Verify the schedule syntax in trivy-cronjob.yaml and check Kubernetes logs for errors.
	•	Resource Limits on Trivy Operator: Adjust resource allocation in trivy-operator/values.yaml if the operator consumes excessive resources.
	•	OpenStack Storage Access: Ensure OpenStack credentials are correct and that the S3-compatible endpoint is accessible from within the cluster.
	•	Report Upload Failures: Check the trivy-reports-uploader container logs for errors related to upload operations. Verify access permissions to OpenStack S3.
